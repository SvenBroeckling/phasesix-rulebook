These rules apply in addition to the basic rules when playing in the world of Tirakan.

The world of the Realms of Tirakan has some peculiarities, which are also reflected in the rules used. For example, the world has **magic** and **faith** levels, which depend on the century of the game, but also on the location of the action. **Special attacks** allow for some flexibility in combat, and rules for **priests** describe the special closeness of the Tirakanian deity world to the peoples of the world.

## Special Attacks

There are a number of special attacks that a character can use to refine or change their attack.

### Accurate Attack

In the accurate attack, the character aims longer to land a better hit. The exchange ratio here is 1 action for reducing the minimum roll by 1. The exchange can also go over turns. The minimum roll can be reduced by a maximum of the character's Perception value, but cannot go below 2. No other action can be taken during this time. After that, a normal attack is made with the changed values.

### K.O. Attack

The K.O. Attack has only the intention of knocking an opponent out, but without inflicting any damage. The attacker must wield a blunt weapon, or at least strike with a blunt object. If the attack is successful, the opponent roll a resistance check. If he does not achieve as many successes as there are hits, he is knocked out.

The attack does not inflict any wounds. Cover and armor are taken into account as usual.

### Massive attack

In a massive attack, the character gathers all his strength to deliver a massive blow. For each additional action the character invests in this attack, the number of dice for this attack increases by 3, up to a maximum of the character's strength value.

### Disarming attack

With a disarming attack, the attacker tries to knock the weapon out of the opponent's hand. To do this, he must succeed in an attack on the weapon's arm, with a minimum roll raised by 3. The attacked person must roll on his strength or deftness after the attack, and achieve at least as many successes as the attacker had hits.

If the attacked fails to do so, he has been disarmed.

### Two-handed fighting

If the character is particularly skilled in the use of a weapon, he can wield two weapons of the same type at the same time, i.e. ambidextrously. Two-handed fighting is only possible with one-handed weapons. Weapons that are wielded with both hands anyway (heavy axes, polearms, etc.) cannot be wielded in two-handed combat.

If a character wields two weapons of the same type at the same time, the character gets one more action per combat round. The weapon he wields with his secondary hand attacks with a minimum roll increased by 1.

## Magic

The magic of Tirakan is special in different ways. There is a **level** of magic in the world that affects the strength of spells. In addition, magic is always of a **origin**, and spells can cause **side effects**.

### Magic level

The world of Tirakan has a magic level that evolves over the centuries. There are also special places,
where the magic level differs from the usual.

* 1st century: Magic level 1
* 2nd century: Magic level 2
* 3rd century: Magic level 3
* 4th century: Magic level 4
* 5th century: Magic level 5
* 6th century: Magic level 4
* 7th century: Magic level 3
* 8th century: Magic level 2
* 9th century: Magic level 1
* 10th century: Magic level 0

The magic level is added to the power of each cast spell.

If the magic level is above 5, the cast magic is completely chaotic and unreliable. The game master decides exactly how a spell is cast. In addition, any spell cast at a magic level of 6 or higher will definitely cause **side effects**.

### Side effects

Magic on Tirakan is unstable, and side effects can occur. Whenever a spell roll shows exactly **two ones**, side effects occur, regardless of whether the spell succeeds or fails.

* The exact effects on the spell are in the hands of the game master. There can be small deviations from the description, but also a complete reversal.
* Side effects affect magic storages. These have a chance to explode if there are side effects near them. If side effects occur in the immediate vicinity of a magic storage, a d6 is rolled for each arcana stored in the magic storage. The magic store loses one arcana for every 1 that is rolled. The explosion causes **3 hits of 2 wounds each and pierce 1** to all characters within 3 steps for each arcana. Cover and armor apply as usual.

### Magic Duel

In some of the following rules, **Magical Duel** is a rule used. Mages may engage in a magical duel.

If the duel is initiated by a mage, the challenged mage must agree to the duel or it will not occur. There is no effect if a duel is refused. The duel takes place exclusively in the mind, no physical actions are required.

To adopt spells, no consent to a magical duel is required, the test is simply rolled.

To perform a magical duel, both opponents cast on their **spellcasting ability**. The contestant with the most successes wins the duel. The loser takes the difference in successes direct wounds. Protection and cover do not prevent wounds in this case.

### Taking over other people's spells

If a spell is active, it can be taken over by a mage. To do this, a **magic duel** is performed, whereby the mage casts against the **spellcasting value** of the mage who performed the spell. If the duel is successful, the spell is now under control of the taker, and can be **dropped**, for example.

### Redirecting spells

Own spells can be redirected as long as they are active. Redirecting a spell requires an action, and a roll on the **casting skill**. It costs 1 arcana to redirect a spell to another target. The target here must be a valid target for the spell. Thus, a spell with a range of 0 (touch) cannot be redirected to a distant target.

### Magic and armor

Wearing armor does not directly hinder the casting of magic. Neither the material of the armor, nor the design of the armor type have any influence on the casting of spells. However, armor that greatly restricts the freedom of movement may cause difficulties in necessary gestures of execution.

Armor of the **Heavy Armor** type increases the minimum casting roll when casting spells by its **encumbrance**.

## Gods and Priests

The deity world of Tirakan is diverse and difficult for amateurs to keep track of. All cultures of the world have their own deities, which are more or less present. In general, gods on Tirakan are very approachable, many can be invoked directly. The peoples of Tirakan pray for certain weather, for personal luck, for success in battle, or for fellow humans.

These rules reflect the closeness of the peoples to the world of the gods.

### Level of belief

Similar to magic, Tirakan's faith evolves over the centuries. While the churches pray for a long time in silent waiting for the return of the gods' work, the influence of the gods develops into a very strong, direct influence by the end of the age. This is represented by the **faith level**, which behaves similarly to the **magic level** and changes over the centuries.

* 1st century: Faith level 1
* 2nd century: Faith level 1
* 3rd century: Faith level 1
* 4th century: Faith level 1
* 5th century: Faith level 1
* 6th century: Faith level 2
* 7th century: Faith level 3
* 8th century: Faith level 4
* 9th century: Faith level 5
* 10th century: Faith level 6

### Favor

As a value, favor represents the relationship between services of the priest and favors of the god. The value is 0 at the beginning and can become negative or positive.

The cost of the favors is subtracted from the favor. Favor points can be gained by the priest through godly actions in the game. It depends very much on the type of deity, with which the priest can rise in the deity's favor.

### Relics

Relics have a special role in the churches of Tirakan. They strengthen the bond with the god and help the believer to continue on his path.

Common relics are objects from the possession of saints, but also bones of them. But even a simple object related to the deity can be a low level relic, such as a special stone for Tador. The character can get to a relic in many different ways, but it always requires a consecration.

Relics always have a level, which can range from 1 to 6. A level 1 relic can be an object that a saint once touched, for example. A level 6 relic can be a holy weapon or the bones of a saint.

i### The forms of invocation

There are four forms of invocation to a god. Each of them is performed differently. Each has a different effort and requests a different favor from the deity.

Common to all forms of invocation is the influence of the environment, the priest's condition, as well as faith level of the world. Thus, the following modifications are added to the **minimum roll** of each invocation (there are invocations that require multiple rolls).

* Favor of the priest: **-(favor/2)**
* The intention of the character does not correspond to the virtues of the deity: **+10**
* Ceremonial design (candles, clean cloths, etc.) not present: **+5**
* The attitude of the priest is contrary to the deity: **+15**
* The request is not the first request of the day: **+2**
* Sacrifice is offered: **-3**
* The priest uses incense: **-2**
* The invocation is done on Doldag: **-2**
* The invocation is chanted (additional chanting rehearsal): **-5**
* The prevailing level of faith: **-faith level**
* Additional priests at the invocation: **-Number**
* Relic present: **-Level**

#### Shock prayer

The least form of request is the Shock Prayer. In a short, pleading invocation of 3 seconds, the priest can gain a bonus to one of his attributes or skills. The bonus is equal to **faith level** points and lasts for **faith level** minutes.

A Shock Prayer requires a single **Charm** roll.

The Shock Prayer costs the priest 2 favor points.

#### Blessing

A blessing is able to break a divine curse (the work of a dark god, as indicated by the work in each case), but can also be transferred to an object to create a blessed weapon, holy water, or the like. To cast the blessing takes 5 minutes, and it lasts indefinitely.

A Blessing requires a Willpower and a Charm check.

The blessing costs the priest 5 favor points.

#### Lesser request

The Lesser Request invokes direct divine action. In it, the abilities of the character's deity and all of its servants that are classified as "minor" can be requested. The prayer for the low petition takes about 15 minutes. It can also be done as part of a ceremonial service.

A charm roll is required for the minor supplication.

#### Invocation

The invocation requests a deity's work that is classified as "higher". Again, both the deity of the character and its servants may be invoked. The invocation requires a larger ceremony and lasts at least 30 minutes. It can also be done as part of a ceremonial service.

The invocation requires 2 charm rolls and a willpower roll.

#### Consecration

With the consecration, an item such as a weapon is given to a god. The divine power ensures that the item is improved (stats plus about 30-50%), however there is also a chance that the item will be ensouled after the consecration and have some life of its own.

A consecration is a two-hour ceremony during which the deity is invoked three times by means of a charm roll. In addition, a test of strength is required as the item is held for the entire period. Finally, a 50% chance of ensoulment is thrown.

The consecration costs the priest 7 favor points.

#### Silent prayer

Once per day, the priest may spend one hour in silent devotion to his deity. For this, he rolls a **charm** roll and adds one favor point for each success.

#### Ceremonial Service

Ceremonial service is a service to the deity to strengthen their work and spread their word. The service can be both a classical ceremony in memory of the deity and something like a ritual funeral or exorcism. Minor petitions or invocations may be made as part of the ceremonial service, but they do not have to be.

A ceremonial service earns the priest one favor point for each participant, up to the double **faith level** per service. If a petition or invocation is performed, this cost is deducted again.
