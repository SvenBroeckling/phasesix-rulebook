To accomplish a Phase Six adventure, each player creates a character to play in the adventure. The character's life is represented entirely on his character sheet, which contains all the relevant stats.

The chapter *Creating a Character* explains exactly how to create a new character. This part will deal with the basic characteristics that make up a character in Phase Six. 

### Persona

The values listed under Persona refer to the character's mental traits. Each value corresponds to a character trait. Persona traits each have their own value and are also the basis for skills.

#### Education

Education describes the character's acquired general knowledge.  A character with high education is good in all theoretical skills like *nature* or *history*.

#### Logic

In contrast to education, the value Logic represents the ability to *reasonably conclude*. Logic always comes into play when solving problems through logical reasoning. In addition, a character with high Logic is better at skills such as *Investigation* or *Mechanics*.

#### Conscientiousness

How conscientious is the character about tasks or activities? Weak conscientiousness makes the character *negligent*, while strong conscientiousness makes for an *organized*, *effective* approach.

#### Willpower

Willpower refers to the character's ability to assert their own ideas and principles. A strong-willed character is good at the skills *Courage* and *Intimidation*, among others.

#### Apprehension

Apprehension describes how well the character is able to perceive his environment and absorb information. A character with good Perception is good at the skills *Perception* and *Orientation*.

#### Charm

A character with high charm knows how to face other people and appear positive to them. This value is not to be confused with the physical trait *Attractiveness*. A Charming character is good at *Politics* and *Empathy* among other things.


### Physis

All physis attributes describe the physical condition of the character. Physis attributes each have a value that specifies the number of dice to roll on that physique attribute.

#### Deftness

This value describes both the physical skill of the character and dexterity. A dexterous character is good at *Performance* and *Stealth*, among other things.

#### Strength

Strength is the pure strength of the character and is always used when it comes to moving something with pure muscle power. A character with high strength can *throw* well and is good at *athletics*.

#### Attractiveness

Attractiveness shows how charismatic the character is. A high value does not necessarily stand for beauty, a character with a striking appearance can also be attractive.

#### Endurance

Endurance is the physical stamina of the character, so not in the sense of patience (this is rather *conscientiousness*) under Persona. So this value comes into play during an endurance run or a long, strenuous activity. 

#### Resistance

Both the ability to withstand or avert injury or pain, and resistance to disease, toxins, or environmental influences such as heat or cold, flow together in this value. 

#### Quickness

Speed is both the speed at which the character can move and the ability to react quickly to something.

### The minimum roll

The minimum roll is a central property of your character. It specifies what result a die must reach to represent a success. The minimum roll is inherited from the lineage and is 5+ for most characters. It can only be changed by special events or rare objects, and often only for a short time.

### Evasion

*Evasion* is used in combat. It allows you to dodge a melee attack. This value is taken from the lineage and increased by the skill *Acrobatics*. Armor or templates can change this value.

### Protection

The *Protection* reduces damage taken in combat. This value is taken from the lineage, armor or templates can change this value.

### Additional dice

Each character can have a number of *bonus dice*, *destiny dice* or *rerolls*. All three have different uses (see Rolls and Checks), but always represent an advantage to the character that can be used during the game. 

The character can regain used dice during the rest (see Wounds and healing).

### Skills

More complex actions or knowledge are described by *skills*. All characters have the same skills with different values. Each skill is composed of a base value and its own skill value. The base value is the average value of two, respectively different, attributes. For example, the base of the skill *Intimidate* is *Apprehension* and *Conscientiousness*. 

The bonuses of the selected character templates are added to the base skill.

### Knowledge

Knowledge works similarly to skills, but here the list is not predetermined. Characters can have different knowledge skills based on their background, which they can use freely. Knowledge is related to one skill at a time. The effective value to roll on is composed of the knowledge value and the skill value.

### Shadows

A character can have special properties that affect him outside of his physical or psychological characteristics. Each *shadow* brings its own description or rule. For example, a character may have a rival or be obedient to authority. Shadows are not rolled on, nor do shadows have values, but they can bring their own rules.
