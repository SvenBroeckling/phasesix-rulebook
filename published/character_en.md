To play a Phase Six adventure, each player must create a character. The character's relevant values are recorded on the character sheet. 

The process of creating a new character is described in detail in the chapter titled [[chapter-create-a-character|Create a Character]]. This chapter outlines the fundamental characteristics that comprise a character in Phase Six.

### Persona

The Persona section lists the character's mental traits. Each trait has its own corresponding value and serves as the basis for skills.

#### Education

Education refers to a character's acquired general knowledge.  A character with a high level of education excels in theoretical skills such as *Nature* and *History*.

#### Logic

Logic is the ability to draw reasonable conclusions, which is particularly important for problem-solving through logical thinking. A character with high Logic is better at skills such as *Investigation* or *Mechanics*.

#### Conscientiousness

Does the character approach tasks or activities conscientiously? Weak conscientiousness leads to carelessness, while strong conscientiousness ensures an organized and effective approach.

#### Willpower

Willpower refers to a character's ability to assert their own ideas and principles. A strong-willed character excels in skills such as *Courage* and *Intimidation*.

#### Apprehension

Apprehension describes how well a character can perceive their surroundings and absorb information. A character with good Apprehension is good at the skills *Perception* and *Orientation*.

#### Charm

A character with high Charm knows how to meet and positively influence other people. This attribute is not to be confused with the physical trait of *Attractiveness*. A charming character is good at, among other things, *Politics* and *Empathy*.

### Physis

All Physis attributes describe the character's physical abilities. Each attribute has a value that indicates the number of dice rolled for that attribute.

#### Deftness

This attribute describes a character's physical ability as well as their dexterity. A skilled character is good at things like *Performance* and *Stealth*.

#### Strength

Strength is the pure strength of the character and is used whenever it is necessary to move something with pure muscle power. A character with high Strength is good at *Throwing* and *Athletics*.

#### Attractiveness

Attractiveness describes the charisma of the character. A high value does not necessarily mean beauty; a character with a striking appearance can also be attractive.

#### Endurance

Endurance is the physical stamina of the character. This attribute comes into play during an endurance run or a long, strenuous activity.

#### Resistance

Both the ability to withstand or avert injury or pain, and resistance to disease, toxins, or environmental influences such as heat or cold, flow together in this value. 

#### Quickness

Speed is both the speed at which the character can move and the ability to react quickly to something.

### The minimum roll

The minimum roll is a central property of your character. It specifies what result a die must reach to represent a success. The minimum roll is inherited from the lineage and is 5+ for most characters. It can only be changed by special events or rare objects, and often only for a short time.

### Evasion

*Evasion* is used in combat. It allows you to dodge a melee attack. The value is equal to the evasion value of the lineage plus the average of quickness and deftness (rounded up). The encumbrance of armor and weapons reduces this value. Character templates can change it.

### Protection

The *Protection* reduces damage taken in combat. This value is taken from the lineage, armor or templates can change this value.

### Additional dice

Each character can have a number of *bonus dice*, *destiny dice* or *rerolls*. All three have different uses (see Rolls and Checks), but always represent an advantage to the character that can be used during the game. 

The character can regain used dice during the rest (see [[chapter-wounds-and-healing|Wounds and healing]]).

### Skills

More complex actions or knowledge are described by *skills*. All characters have the same skills with different values. Each skill is composed of a base value and its own skill value. The base value is the average value of two, respectively different, attributes. For example, the base of the skill *Intimidate* is *Apprehension* and *Conscientiousness*. 

The bonuses of the selected character templates are added to the base skill.

### Knowledge

Knowledge works similarly to skills, but here the list is not predetermined. Characters can have different knowledge skills based on their background, which they can use freely. Knowledge is related to one skill at a time. The effective value to roll on is composed of the knowledge value and the skill value.

### Shadows

A character can have special properties that affect him outside his physical or psychological characteristics. Each *shadow* brings its own description or rule. For example, a character may have a rival or be obedient to authority. Shadows are not rolled on, nor do shadows have values, but they can bring their own rules.
