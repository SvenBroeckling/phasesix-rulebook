Each player creates a character to play a Phase Six adventure. The character is recorded on the character sheet with all relevant values. 

The chapter [[chapter-create-a-character|Creating a character]] describes exactly how to create a new character. This section describes the basic characteristics that make up a character in Phase Six.

### Persona

The values listed under Persona refer to the mental characteristics of the character. Each value corresponds to a personality trait. Persona traits have their own value and are also the base for skills.

#### Education

Education describes the general knowledge a character has acquired. A character with a high level of education is good at all theoretical skills such as *Nature* or *History*.

#### Logic

Unlike *Education*, the value of logic relates to the ability to draw reasonable conclusions. Logic is especially important when it comes to solving problems through logical reasoning. A character with high Logic will be better at skills such as *Investigation* or *Mechanics*.

#### Conscientiousness

How conscientiously does the character approach tasks or activities? A low level of conscientiousness leads to carelessness, whereas a high level of conscientiousness ensures an organised and effective approach.

#### Willpower

Willpower refers to the character's ability to assert their own ideas and principles. A strong-willed character is good at the skills *Courage* and *Intimidation*, among others.

#### Apprehension

Perception describes a character's ability to perceive their surroundings and absorb information. A character with good perception is good at the skills *Perception* and *Orientation*.

#### Charm

A person with a high value for Charm knows how to approach other people and have a positive effect on them. This attribute is not to be confused with the physical trait of *Attractiveness*. A charming character is good at *Politics* and *Empathy*, among other things.

### Physis

All physical attributes describe the character's physical abilities. Each attribute has a value that indicates the number of dice rolled for that attribute.

#### Deftness

This stat describes both the physical dexterity and the agility of the character. A deft character is, among other things, good at *Performance* and *Stealth*.

#### Strength

Strength is the pure strength of the character and is used whenever it is necessary to move something with pure muscle power. A character with high Strength is good at *Throwing* and good at *Athletics*.

#### Attractiveness

Attractiveness describes the charisma of the character. A high value does not necessarily mean beauty; a distinctive character can also be attractive.

#### Endurance

Stamina is the physical endurance of the character, not in the sense of patience (that is more like *Conscientiousness* in Persona). This stat comes into play during an endurance run or a long, strenuous activity.

#### Resistance

This includes the ability to withstand or avoid injury or pain, as well as resistance to disease, toxins or environmental influences such as heat or cold.

#### Quickness

Speed is both the speed at which the character is able to move around and the ability to react quickly to a situation.

### The minimum roll

The minimum roll is a central feature of the character. It specifies the result a die must have to represent a success. The minimum roll is taken from the lineage and is 5+ for most characters. The "Masterly Presence" template lowers the minimum roll by 1, otherwise it can only be changed by special events or rare items, and often only for a short time.

### Evasion

*Evasion is used in combat and allows you to avoid a melee attack. It is equal to the Evasion value of the lineage plus the average of *Quickness* and *Deftness* (rounded up). Armour and weapons reduce this stat. Character templates can change this value.

### Protection

If a character has protection due to their lineage, this is called 'innate protection'. These protections can be used without depleting them; they are available for any attack.

### Additional dice

Each character can have a number of *bonus dice*, *destiny dice* or *rerolls*. All three have different uses (see Rolls and Checks), but always represent an advantage to the character that can be used during the game. 

The character can regain used dice during the rest (see [[chapter-wounds-and-healing|Wounds and healing]]).

### Skills

More complex actions or knowledge are described by *skills*. All characters have the same skills with different values, so the GM can be sure that a player can definitely roll a skill. 

Each skill has a base attribute and a skill value. For example, the base attribute for the skill Intimidate is *Apprehension*.

The base attribute is added to the bonuses of the selected character templates.

#### Intimidation

The Intimidation skill is a measure of how well a character can intimidate others. This skill can be used to extract information from an opponent or to make them retreat from a fight.

Attribute: *Apprehension*

#### Empathy

Empathy is the ability to interpret a person's feelings and moods, and perhaps to recognise intentions. Thoughts cannot be read.

Attribute: *Conscientiousness*

#### Stealth

Stealth is the art of concealment. This skill is used both for stealthy movement (sneaking) and to check how secretive the character is. It can be used, for example, when the character is being interrogated or is tempted to divulge a secret.

Attribute: *Conscientiousness*

#### Magic knowledge

Magic knowledge describes the knowledge of the character in magical topics. Whenever the knowledge of magical artifacts, spells or other teachings is involved, magic knowledge can be cast.

Attribute: *Charm*

#### Orientation

This skill is used for orientation, both in the countryside and in confusing situations. It can be used in the confusing crowds of the city, but also when the character is whirled by a water vortex.

Attribute: *Apprehension*

#### Politics

Whenever it comes to assessing political action, this skill is used. This can be the case in real politics, but can also represent moving safely in large corporations.

Attribute: *Charm*

#### Religion

This skill includes knowledge of religious teachings, as well as confidence in performing religious ceremonies.

Attribute: *Conscientiousness*

#### Courage

This skill comes into play whenever it is a question of how brave a character is. For example, it can be used to determine whether a character is brave enough to face a powerful opponent.

Attribute: *Willpower*

#### Deception

If the character wants to deceive an opponent, or, for example, cheat at the game, this skill can be rolled on.

Attribute: *Charm*

#### Persuasion

If the character wants to convince his counterpart argumentatively, this skill is used.

Attribute: *Willpower*

#### Investigation

This skill is used when the character wants to examine an object, a certain scene or an object for certain properties.

Attribute: *Apprehension*

#### Perception

Perception represents the character's ability to perceive things in his environment. This can be the search of an apartment, the search for the shadowy thief at the edge of the forest, or even a movement in the face of the opponent.

Attribute: *Apprehension*

#### Acrobatics

Acrobatics is the art of moving quickly and skillfully. Unlike athleticism, this skill is used when the character climbs over a ledge or makes a short sprint.

Attribute: *Deftness*

#### Performance

Performance is the artistic presentation. This can be acting, but also the musical performance of a piece. An impressive tall tale can also be told with the help of performance.

Attribute: *Charm*

#### First Aid

First aid must be carried out with sufficient dressing materials to be successful.

If the throw is successful, the person receiving first aid recovers wounds equal to half the successes (rounded up) of the throw.

First aid stops any bleeding.

Attribute: *Conscientiousness*

#### Driving

The Driving skill describes the driving of all kinds of vehicles. The skill applies to all mobile objects such as ships, vehicles or carriages.

Attribute: *Deftness*

#### History

History describes the character's knowledge of history and past events.

Attribute: *Education*

#### Communication

The ability to socialize is described by the skill Communication. It describes how skillfully the character behaves in conversations.

Attribute: *Education*

#### Mechanics

Mechanics includes all manual activities as well as the knowledge of mechanical processes. Working on a piece of wood or understanding a mechanical clock can be mapped with this skill.

Attribute: *Logic*

#### Hand To Hand Combat

The value of this skill is the basis for attacking with melee weapons. This skill is not usually rolled on directly.

Attribute: *Strength*

#### Nature

Nature describes the character's knowledge of all facets of nature. This skill can be used when the character is searching for plants, gathering wood in the forest, or judging the nature of an animal.

Attribute: *Education*

#### Shooting

The value of this skill is the basis for attacking with ranged weapons. This skill is not usually rolled on directly.

Attribute: *Deftness*

#### Throwing

This skill is used whenever the character throws objects. These can be simple objects like stones, but also incendiary charges or grenades.

If the throw fails (no single success is achieved), the deviation is determined as follows:

First, a d12 is thrown to determine the direction of the deviation. The result of the throw gives the direction in the form of the " clock time ", seen by the throwing character looking at the target. A 3 thus deviates to the right of the target, as seen by the throwing character.

Then a d6 is thrown, which determines the distance of the deviation in meters.

The thrown object thus lands at the determined location.

Attribute: *Strength*

#### Spell Casting

The value of this skill is used as a basis for casting spells. This skill is not usually rolled on directly.

Attribute: *Willpower*

### Knowledge

Knowledge works in a similar way to skills, but the list is not predefined. Characters can have different knowledge skills based on their background, which they can use freely. Knowledge is always associated with a skill. The effective die roll value is the sum of the knowledge value and the skill value.

### Shadows

A character can have special traits that affect them outside of their physical or mental attributes. Each *shadow* has its own description or rule. For example, a character may have a rival or be obedient to authority. Shadows do not have values, but can have their own rules.
