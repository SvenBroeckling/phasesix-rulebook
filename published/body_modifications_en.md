The Body Modifications extension allows characters in the game to integrate mechanical components into their bodies. These are artificial elements that can be attached to arms, legs or other limbs.

The body modifications correspond to the time period in which the game is set. For example, a leg implant in the Victorian era will be made of copper or brass, while in the Science Fiction era it will be a futuristic technology.

## Character stats

When playing with the Body Modification extension, the character will have additional information on their character sheet.

### Biostrain

Each body modification affects the character's biological load. As a character integrates body modifications, their biostrain increases.

Biostrain starts at 0; each character is initially unburdened by body modifications. Each body modification has a biostrain value. This is added to the character's value.

#### Effects of Biostrain

Biostrain has various effects on the character.

With every healing, whether spell, first aid or healing by a doctor, half of the biostrain (rounded up) is added to the minimum roll of the respective test.

The minimum roll for casting spells and other magical abilities is increased by half the Biostrain (rounded up).

If the biostrain is greater than 5, the following effects apply:

* The character's *Endurance* drops by 1 point.
* The number of *Rest* dice for each Rest check drops by 1.

If the Biostrain is greater than 10, the following effects apply:

* The character's *Endurance* drops by 2 points.
* The number of *Rest* dice for each Rest check drops by 2.

If the Biostrain is greater than 15, the following effects apply:

* The character's *Endurance* drops by 3 points.
* The number of *Rest* dice for each Resting roll drops by 3.

### Energy

Body modifications require energy to function. Some body modifications feed energy into the local power grid. However, functional body modifications usually require energy to function.

In order for a character's body modifications to function properly, an energy balance must be created. The sum of the energy points of all built-in body modifications must be 0 or greater for everything to work properly. If the total is less than 0, the *Energy Deficiency* rule applies.

Activatable body modifications only use energy when activated. Passive body modifications always require energy to function.

Energy is measured in milliamperes (mA).

#### Energy surplus

If more energy is fed into the local grid than is needed, an energy surplus occurs. Normally this is not a problem, but if the energy surplus exceeds 10mA, electrical discharges can occur.

Whenever an activatable body modification is activated and the energy surplus is 10 mA or more, a *Resistance* roll is made. The minimum roll is increased by the amount of excess energy.

If the roll fails, the character receives a wound and a *shocked 1*.

#### Energy deficit

An energy deficit occurs when less energy is fed into the local grid than is needed. This can cause body modifications to stop working. Each time a body modification is activated, a die roll is made according to the energy deficit. For each roll that results in a 1, the modification will not function until the next *rest*.

The player chooses which modifications will not work.

### Slots

Each body has a set number of slots. These slots cannot be changed unless you invest in special body modifications that allow additional slots for specific limbs.

Each body modification specifies how many slots it requires in a particular body region.

For humans, the number of attachment points is as follows

* **Head**: 3
* **Torso**: 5
* **Arms**: 3
* **Legs**: 3

If a body region is loaded with too many modifications, the biostrain *of all* modifications is counted twice.

## Body modifications

* **Price**: This is the average purchase price of the body modification at the time of purchase. This price is given in the base unit of the currency used.
* **Rarity**: The rarity describes how available the body modification is on the market. This can be *common*, *uncommon*, *rare*, *legendary* or *unique*.
* **Type**: Body modifications have a type, common types are *Generator*, *Sensor*, *Weapon*, *Prosthetic*, *Protection* or *Enhancement*.
* **Extension**: In general, body modifications are available when playing with this extension. However, some body modifications are only available in certain eras.
* **Rules**: Each body modification can have its own rules, which are described here.
* **Biostrain**: The biostrain describes the biological strain the modification places on the body. This is added to the character's stats.
* **Energy Requirement**: Each modification has an energy requirement. If this is negative, the modification produces energy. The character's energy balance must be in balance; no more energy may be consumed than is produced. Energy is measured in mA.
* **Charges**: Some modifications have charges that are consumed.
* **Activation**: Some modifications require activation, others are always active. Activatable modifications only consume power when activated.

### Activatable and passive modifications

If a modification requires activation, this will be indicated in the description. This modification only consumes energy when it is activated. Activating a modification costs an action.

Passive modifications are always active and consume energy.

### Integrating modifications

Integrating modifications into the body requires surgery. Depending on the complexity of the modification, this operation may be complicated or impossible to perform without risk.

The surgeon performing the surgery must make a **Medicine** roll to successfully perform the modification. The minimum roll for this check is increased by the biostrain of the modification.

### Removing modifications

If you wish to remove a body modification, this can only be done by surgery. The surgeon performing the surgery must make a die roll on **Medicine** to successfully remove the modification. The minimum roll for this check is increased by the biostrain of the modification.
