The character gains experience over time and develops based on templates.

### Reputation

A character's reputation reflects their level of recognition and life experience.

Reputation is divided into spent and earned reputation, which are separated by a slash. The reputation points earned are placed after the slash, while the reputation points used for promotion are placed before it. Character templates can be purchased for unused reputation points.

#### Gaining reputation

The character earns reputation for completing successful adventures.  

The game master awards reputation, typically between 5-10 points per adventure, but may also award reputation directly for individual actions. Successful actions or scenes in the game can result in the game master awarding a certain number of reputation points.

### Developing the character

After each game session, the player can obtain templates from the categories of *character*, *interests*, *environment*, and *talent*. It is not possible to add new templates from the categories of *occupation* and *education*.

The character can be further developed during an adventure by adding additional templates. The templates are recorded in the same way as during character creation, and changes to the values are calculated directly on the character sheet.
