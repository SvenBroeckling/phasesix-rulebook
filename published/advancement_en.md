Over time, the character gains experience and develops further. As with character creation, this development is based on character templates.

### Reputation

A character's reputation reflects their level of recognition and life experience.

Reputation is divided into spent and earned reputation, separated by a slash. Earned reputation points are placed after the slash, and used reputation points are placed before the slash. Unused reputation points can be used to purchase character templates.

#### Gaining reputation

The character gains reputation for successful quests. Reputation is awarded by the GM and should be between 5 and 10 per session. 

Reputation can also be awarded directly for individual actions. A successful action or scene in the game can result in the GM awarding a certain number of reputation points.

### Developing the character

Further development takes place after each game session, enabling the character to be expanded with additional templates, even during an adventure.

Templates are selected in the same way as when creating a character and purchased using reputation. They are then applied. Any changes to values are calculated directly on the character sheet and take effect immediately.

### New spells

If a character gains new spell points through character templates, they can immediately use these to learn new spells or choose spell modifications. There is no need to research a thesis in the game for this.
